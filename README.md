<h1>COVID-19 analysis and visualization using Plotly</h1>

The purpose of this side project was to practice data visualization with Plotly, as I had not used this library in my data analytic studies at JAMK. I focused my visualization on disease situation in Finland and Europe in particular. I got the idea from a data project article on the Geeksforgeeks website. Three csv files were used in the project.

**covid.csv** – This dataset contains Country/Region, Continent, Population, TotalCases, NewCases, TotalDeaths, NewDeaths, TotalRecovered, NewRecovered, ActiveCases, Serious, Critical, Tot Cases/1M pop, Deaths/1M pop, TotalTests, Tests/1M pop, WHO Region, iso_alpha.

**covid_grouped.csv** – This dataset contains Date(from 20-01-22 to 20-07-27), Country/Region, Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Active, New cases, New deaths, New recovered, WHO Region, iso_alpha.

**coviddeath.csv** – This dataset contains real-world examples of a number of Covid-19 deaths and the reasons behind the deaths.

<h4>Plotly visualizations are not available on Github, but you can view them here by entering the link to my repository in the search box :)</h4>
